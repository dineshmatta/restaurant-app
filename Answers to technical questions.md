1) How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I spend 3-4 hrs on finishing this project to a state where it is right now, but if I would have got some more time I would have improved following more things:

 - Improved UI
 - Added more test cases
 - Addition of Error boundries functions for better error handling
 
2) What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

React 16.8.0 introduced hooks, here is code I have used in the submitted application - https://github.com/dineshmatta/restaurant-app/blob/master/src/components/Forms/InputCityForm.js

3) How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Performace issues - checking the bundle size of all assets, if any assets size is more then that bundle can be optimized by splitting into multiple modules, I mainly take care of this before pushing to production

4) How would you improve the API that you just used?

API returned response was good but can be improved by adding more information on the resource being requested, like rating and cusine types available for restaurant was not avaialble

5) Please describe yourself using JSON.
